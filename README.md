# User Workspace API

## Project Overview

User Workspace is a simple task management API built with Node.js and Express. The API facilitates the management of tasks using various HTTP methods, providing endpoints for task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the server:**

   Start the server using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using HTTP requests. You can use tools like `Postman` or `cURL` to test the endpoints. For example, to create a task, you can send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/api/tasks` with the appropriate JSON payload:

```json
{
    "title": "New Task",
    "description": "Description of the task"
}
```

## Features

- Task creation
- Task retrieval (get all tasks or a single task)
- Task updating
- Task deletion
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

## Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies, as defined in `package.json`:

- **[`express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **[`cors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)**: Package that provides a middleware to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- **[`sqlite3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3)**: Node.js bindings for SQLite3, a lightweight database.
